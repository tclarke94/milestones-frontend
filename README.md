Milestones-Tracker is an app designed to allow you to track and share development and accomplishments of babies and children up to two years old. There are profiles for the individual babies that will display a clickable checklist to mark achievements.

Technologies used: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node.js, Netlify and Heroku

Future goals are to complete the one-to-many models of the checklist and the baby profiles. I also plan to further stylize past my current MVP design.
